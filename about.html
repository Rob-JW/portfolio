        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
        After 20 years of military service with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, I possess a wealth of experience and a steadfast commitment to excellence.

        I am the Artificer Sergeant Major and lead engineer for 8 Parachute Filed Company, we provide high-level mechanical and engineering support to 16 Air Assault Brigade. Here my role sees me at the forefront of maintaining and repairing a diverse array of military equipment valued at over Â£20m, both in conventional settings and on demanding overseas deployments.

        As the lead engineer, my key responsibilities are to ensure that my organization conforms to current safety, legislative, and regulatory standards, including Health and Safety regulations, Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations and VOSA standards. 

        I possess a keen eye for detail and a passion for innovation with a proven ability to excel in project management. I am also eager to broaden my horizons by exploring new opportunities in Cyber Security and Software Development.

        I hold a HND in automotive engineering from the esteemed Defence School of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering. I am pursuing a Master's Degree in engineering management to elevate my expertise further and drive my career forward.

        Let's connect and see where our paths may take us.
